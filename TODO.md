# TODO

* Add "adding a file", not just "modifying a file" as recognized thing.
    * not just pulling in your added files, but knowing that adding a
      file means you need to change the Makefile, that sort of thing.
* Add more tests
* Sanity checks are missing in some places.
* Add a gitreviewers command that looks for who should review your commit based
  on who else has committed to the files you are changing.
* Work with a range of commits instead of a single commit so you can run it on
  an entire pull request.
